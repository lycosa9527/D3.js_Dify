# Thinking Maps Guide

Based on the official Thinking Maps速 methodology developed by David Hyerle, this guide explains the 8 fundamental thinking maps and their proper data structures for use with D3.js rendering.

## Overview

Thinking Maps速 are consistent visual patterns linked directly to eight specific thought processes. They help visualize abstract thoughts to reach higher levels of critical and creative thinking. Each map corresponds to a fundamental cognitive skill.

## The 8 Thinking Maps

### 1. Circle Map - For Defining in Context
**Cognitive Process**: Defining in context

**Purpose**: Used for brainstorming and defining a topic in context. The central circle contains the main topic, and the outer circle contains context information.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Main topic or concept",
  "context": [
    "Context item 1",
    "Context item 2",
    "Context item 3"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Photosynthesis",
  "context": [
    "Plants use sunlight",
    "Converts CO2 to oxygen",
    "Process in chloroplasts",
    "Essential for life on Earth"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Bubble Map - For Describing Attributes
**Cognitive Process**: Describing attributes

**Purpose**: Used to describe a topic using adjectives and descriptive phrases. The central bubble contains the topic, and surrounding bubbles contain descriptive attributes.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Main topic or object",
  "attributes": [
    "Attribute 1",
    "Attribute 2",
    "Attribute 3"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Ocean",
  "attributes": [
    "Deep",
    "Salty",
    "Blue",
    "Vast",
    "Mysterious",
    "Home to marine life"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Double Bubble Map - For Comparing and Contrasting
**Cognitive Process**: Comparing and contrasting

**Purpose**: Used to compare and contrast two topics. Similarities are placed in bubbles between the two main topics, while differences are placed in bubbles connected to each individual topic.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "left": "First topic",
  "right": "Second topic",
  "similarities": [
    "Similarity 1",
    "Similarity 2",
    "Similarity 3"
  ],
  "left_differences": [
    "Difference unique to left topic 1",
    "Difference unique to left topic 2"
  ],
  "right_differences": [
    "Difference unique to right topic 1",
    "Difference unique to right topic 2"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "left": "Dogs",
  "right": "Cats",
  "similarities": [
    "Mammals",
    "Domestic pets",
    "Have four legs",
    "Carnivores"
  ],
  "left_differences": [
    "Bark",
    "Pack animals",
    "Need regular walks"
  ],
  "right_differences": [
    "Meow",
    "Independent",
    "Use litter box"
  ]
}
```

### 4. Tree Map - For Categorizing
**Cognitive Process**: Classifying

**Purpose**: Used for classifying and categorizing information. The main category is at the top, with subcategories below, and specific examples under each subcategory.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Main category",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "subcategory1",
      "label": "Subcategory 1",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "example1",
          "label": "Example 1"
        },
        {
          "id": "example2",
          "label": "Example 2"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "subcategory2",
      "label": "Subcategory 2",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "example3",
          "label": "Example 3"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Animals",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "mammals",
      "label": "Mammals",
      "children": [
        {"id": "dog", "label": "Dog"},
        {"id": "cat", "label": "Cat"},
        {"id": "elephant", "label": "Elephant"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "birds",
      "label": "Birds",
      "children": [
        {"id": "eagle", "label": "Eagle"},
        {"id": "sparrow", "label": "Sparrow"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Brace Map - For Whole/Part Relationships
**Cognitive Process**: Part-whole spatial reasoning

**Purpose**: Used to analyze physical objects by breaking them down into parts and subparts. The whole object is on the left, with parts and subparts branching to the right.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "main_topic": "Whole object or concept",
  "parts": [
    "Part 1",
    "Part 2",
    "Part 3"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "main_topic": "Computer",
  "parts": [
    "Monitor",
    "Keyboard",
    "Mouse",
    "CPU",
    "Speakers"
  ]
}
```

### 6. Flow Map - For Sequencing
**Cognitive Process**: Sequencing

**Purpose**: Used for sequencing and ordering information. Shows the stages and substages of an event or process in chronological order.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "title": "Process or event name",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1",
    "Step 2",
    "Step 3",
    "Step 4"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "title": "Water Cycle",
  "steps": [
    "Evaporation",
    "Condensation",
    "Precipitation",
    "Collection"
  ]
}
```

### 7. Multi-Flow Map - For Cause and Effect
**Cognitive Process**: Cause and effect reasoning

**Purpose**: Used to show cause and effect relationships. The central event is in the middle, with causes on the left and effects on the right.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "event": "Central event or situation",
  "causes": [
    "Cause 1",
    "Cause 2",
    "Cause 3"
  ],
  "effects": [
    "Effect 1",
    "Effect 2",
    "Effect 3"
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "event": "Global Warming",
  "causes": [
    "Burning fossil fuels",
    "Deforestation",
    "Industrial emissions",
    "Vehicle emissions"
  ],
  "effects": [
    "Rising temperatures",
    "Melting ice caps",
    "Sea level rise",
    "Extreme weather events"
  ]
}
```

### 8. Bridge Map - For Analogies
**Cognitive Process**: Reasoning by analogy

**Purpose**: Used to show analogies and similarities between relationships. The relating factor is on the left, with pairs of related items on either side of the bridge.

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "relating_factor": "The common relationship",
  "analogies": [
    {
      "left_pair": {
        "top": "First item in left pair",
        "bottom": "Second item in left pair"
      },
      "right_pair": {
        "top": "First item in right pair",
        "bottom": "Second item in right pair"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "relating_factor": "is a type of",
  "analogies": [
    {
      "left_pair": {
        "top": "Dog",
        "bottom": "Animal"
      },
      "right_pair": {
        "top": "Rose",
        "bottom": "Flower"
      }
    },
    {
      "left_pair": {
        "top": "Car",
        "bottom": "Vehicle"
      },
      "right_pair": {
        "top": "Airplane",
        "bottom": "Vehicle"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Validation
Each thinking map type has a corresponding validation function in `graph_specs.py` that ensures:
- Required fields are present
- Data types are correct
- Content limits are reasonable
- Nested structures are valid

### Rendering
The D3.js renderer should interpret each map type according to its visual pattern:
- **Circle Map**: Concentric circles
- **Bubble Map**: Central bubble with surrounding attribute bubbles
- **Double Bubble Map**: Two main bubbles with connecting similarity bubbles
- **Tree Map**: Hierarchical tree structure
- **Brace Map**: Left-to-right part breakdown
- **Flow Map**: Sequential flow from left to right
- **Multi-Flow Map**: Central event with causes (left) and effects (right)
- **Bridge Map**: Bridge structure with pairs on either side

### Educational Benefits
Thinking Maps help students:
- Develop critical thinking skills
- Organize information visually
- Make connections between concepts
- Improve comprehension and retention
- Build cognitive processing skills
